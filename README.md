# NAVPH 2024
Code samples for lectures from the course _Game Development and Design_.

More info on the course website: https://gamedev.flamingchain.com/

## Lectures
There's a separate folder for each lecture:
* Lecture 04 - Unity Scripting - [Assets/Lecture04/](Assets/Lecture04/)
* Lecture 06 - Game Physics - [Assets/Lecture06/](Assets/Lecture06/)

## Project Setup
Derived from Unity's basic 3D URP template.

Some important files of note:
* `.gitignore` - to ignore standard Unity files in Git
* `.gitattributes` - marks which files will be committed to Git LFS
* `.editorconfig` - makes sure coding standards for C# are unified everywhere. If you are using VSCode, install  [EditorConfig extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

## Assets
Uses some external (fully free) assets:
* The first person character controller from [Starter Assets: Character Controllers | URP](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-character-controllers-urp-267961)
* Explosion prefab extracted from Unity's deprecated [Standard Assets 2018.4](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/standard-assets-2018-4-check-out-starter-assets-first-person-thi-32351)
